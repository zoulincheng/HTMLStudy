/*
Escape Sequences in Strings





Quotes are not the only characters that can be escaped inside a string. Here is a table of common escape sequences:


Code

Output


\' single quote 
\" double quote 
\\ backslash 
\n new line 
\r carriage return 
\t tab 
\b backspace 
\f form feed 

Note that the backslash itself must be escaped in order to display as a backslash.

Instructions

Encode the following sequence, separated by spaces:
backslash tab tab carriage-return new-line and assign it to myStr


var myStr; // Change this line
*/


var myStr = '\\ \t \t \r \n'; // Change this line
