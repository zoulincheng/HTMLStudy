/*
Appending Variables to Strings


Just as we can build a string over multiple lines out of string literals, we can also append variables to a string using the plus equals (+=) operator.

Instructions

Set someAdjective and append it to myStr using the += operator.


// Example
var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "Free Code Camp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;

// Only change code below this line

var someAdjective;
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";



*/



// Example
var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "Free Code Camp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;

// Only change code below this line

var someAdjective = "adfafdsaf";
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr += someAdjective;
