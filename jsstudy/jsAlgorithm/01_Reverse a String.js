/*
The split() method splits a String object into an array of strings by separating the string into substrings.

Syntax
str.split([separator[, limit]])

Parameters
separatorOptional. Specifies the character(s) to use for separating the string. The separator is treated as a string or a regular expression. If separator is omitted, the array returned contains one element consisting of the entire string. If separator is an empty string, str is converted to an array of characters.limit
Optional. Integer specifying a limit on the number of splits to be found. The split() method still splits on every match of separator, until the number of split items match the limit or the string falls short of seperator.

Description

The split() method returns the new array.

When found, separator is removed from the string and the substrings are returned in an array. If separator is not found or is omitted, the array contains one element consisting of the entire string. If separator is an empty string, str is converted to an array of characters.

If separator is a regular expression that contains capturing parentheses, then each time separator is matched, the results (including any undefined results) of the capturing parentheses are spliced into the output array. However, not all browsers support this capability.


ï€–Note: When the string is empty, split() returns an array containing one empty string, rather than an empty array. If the string and separator are both empty strings, an empty array is returned. 


Examples

Using split()

The following example defines a function that splits a string into an array of strings using the specified separator. After splitting the string, the function displays messages indicating the original string (before the split), the separator used, the number of elements in the array, and the individual array elements.
function splitString(stringToSplit, separator) {
  var arrayOfStrings = stringToSplit.split(separator);

  console.log('The original string is: "' + stringToSplit + '"');
  console.log('The separator is: "' + separator + '"');
  console.log('The array has ' + arrayOfStrings.length + ' elements: ' + arrayOfStrings.join(' / '));
}

var tempestString = 'Oh brave new world that has such people in it.';
var monthString = 'Jan,Feb,Mar,Apr,May,Jun,Jul,Aug,Sep,Oct,Nov,Dec';

var space = ' ';
var comma = ',';

splitString(tempestString, space);
splitString(tempestString);
splitString(monthString, comma);1234567891011121314151617

This example produces the following output:
The original string is: "Oh brave new world that has such people in it."
The separator is: " "
The array has 10 elements: Oh / brave / new / world / that / has / such / people / in / it.

The original string is: "Oh brave new world that has such people in it."
The separator is: "undefined"
The array has 1 elements: Oh brave new world that has such people in it.

The original string is: "Jan,Feb,Mar,Apr,May,Jun,Jul,Aug,Sep,Oct,Nov,Dec"
The separator is: ","
The array has 12 elements: Jan / Feb / Mar / Apr / May / Jun / Jul / Aug / Sep / Oct / Nov / Dec1234567891011

Removing spaces from a string

In the following example, split() looks for 0 or more spaces followed by a semicolon followed by 0 or more spaces and, when found, removes the spaces from the string. nameList is the array returned as a result of split().
var names = 'Harry Trump ;Fred Barney; Helen Rigby ; Bill Abel ;Chris Hand ';

console.log(names);

var re = /\s*;\s*/;
var nameList = names.split(re);

console.log(nameList);12345678

This logs two lines; the first line logs the original string, and the second line logs the resulting array.
Harry Trump ;Fred Barney; Helen Rigby ; Bill Abel ;Chris Hand
Harry Trump,Fred Barney,Helen Rigby,Bill Abel,Chris Hand12

Returning a limited number of splits

In the following example, split() looks for 0 or more spaces in a string and returns the first 3 splits that it finds.
var myString = 'Hello World. How are you doing?';
var splits = myString.split(' ', 3);

console.log(splits);1234

This script displays the following:
Hello,World.,How1

Capturing parentheses

If separator contains capturing parentheses, matched results are returned in the array.
var myString = 'Hello 1 word. Sentence number 2.';
var splits = myString.split(/(\d)/);

console.log(splits);1234

This script displays the following:
Hello ,1, word. Sentence number ,2,.1

Reversing a String using split()
var str = 'asdfghjkl';
var strReverse = str.split('').reverse().join(''); // 'lkjhgfdsa'
// split() returns an array on which reverse() and join() can be applied123

Bonus: use === operator to test if the original string was palindrome.
