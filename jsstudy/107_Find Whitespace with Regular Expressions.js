/*
Find Whitespace with Regular Expressions


We can also use regular expression selectors like \s to find whitespace in a string.

The whitespace characters are " " (space), \r (the carriage return), \n (newline), \t (tab), and \f (the form feed).

The whitespace regular expression looks like this:

/\s+/g

Instructions

Use \s to select all the whitespace characters in the sentence string.


// Setup
var testString = "How many spaces are there in this sentence?";

// Only change code below this line.

var expression = /.+/g;  // Change this line

// Only change code above this line

// This code counts the matches of expression in testString
var spaceCount = testString.match(expression).length;
