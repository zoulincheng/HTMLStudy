/*
Constructing Strings with Variables





Sometimes you will need to build a string, Mad Libs ? style. By using the concatenation operator (+), you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building.

Instructions

Set myName to a string equal to your name and build myStr with myName between the strings "My name is " and " and I am swell!"


// Example
var ourName = "Free Code Camp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";

// Only change code below this line
var myName;
var myStr;





*/


// Example
var ourName = "Free Code Camp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";

// Only change code below this line
var myName = "linch";
var myStr = "My name is " + myName + " and I am swell!";
