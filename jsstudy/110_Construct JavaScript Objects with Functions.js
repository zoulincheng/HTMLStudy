/*
Construct JavaScript Objects with Functions


We are also able to create objects using constructor functions.

A constructor function is given a capitalized name to make it clear that it is a constructor.

Here's an example of a constructor function:
var Car = function() {
  this.wheels = 4;
  this.engines = 1;
  this.seats = 1;
};

In a constructor the this variable refers to the new object being created by the constructor. So when we write,

  this.wheels = 4;

inside of the constructor we are giving the new object it creates a property called wheels with a value of 4.

You can think of a constructor as a description for the object it will create.

Have your MotorBike constructor describe an object with wheels, engines and seats properties and set them to numbers.



var Car = function() {
  this.wheels = 4;
  this.engines = 1;
  this.seats = 1;
};

// Only change code below this line.

var MotorBike = function() {

};


*/


var Car = function() {
  this.wheels = 4;
  this.engines = 1;
  this.seats = 1;
};

// Only change code below this line.

var MotorBike = function() {
  this.wheels = 2;
  this.engines = 1;
  this.seats = 2;
};
