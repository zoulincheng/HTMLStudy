/*
Store Multiple Values in one Variable using JavaScript Arrays





With JavaScript array variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.

You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, end it with a closing square bracket, and put a comma between each entry, like this:
var sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"].

Instructions

Create a new array called myArray that contains both a string and a number (in that order).

Hint
Refer to the example code in the text editor if you get stuck.


// Example
var array = ["John", 23];

// Only change code below this line.
var myArray = [];



*/


// Example
var array = ["John", 23];

// Only change code below this line.
var myArray = ["a", 4];
