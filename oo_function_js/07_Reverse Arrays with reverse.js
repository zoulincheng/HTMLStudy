/**
 * Reverse Arrays with reverse
You can use the reverse method to reverse the elements of an array.

reverse is another array method that alters the array in place, but it also returns the reversed array.

var myArray = [1, 2, 3];
myArray.reverse();
returns [3, 2, 1]

Use reverse to reverse the array variable and assign it to newArray.
var array = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7];
var newArray = [];

// Only change code below this line.

newArray = array;

 */


var array = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7];
var newArray = [];

// Only change code below this line.

newArray = array.reverse();

console.log(array);
console.log(newArray);
