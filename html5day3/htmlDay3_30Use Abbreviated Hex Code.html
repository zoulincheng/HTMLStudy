<!--Use Abbreviated Hex CodeMany people feel overwhelmed by the possibilities of more than 16 million colors. And it's difficult to remember hex code. Fortunately, you can shorten it.For example, red, which is #FF0000 in hex code, can be shortened to #F00. That is, one digit for red, one digit for green, one digit for blue.This reduces the total number of possible colors to around 4,000. But browsers will interpret #FF0000 and #F00 as exactly the same color.Go ahead, try using #F00 to turn the body element's background-color red.<style>  body {    background-color: #111111;  }</style>--><style>  body {    background-color: #f00;  }</style>
