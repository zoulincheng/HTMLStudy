/**
 * Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition
In programming, it is common to use assignments to modify the contents of a variable. 
Remember that everything to the right of the equals sign is evaluated first, so we can say:

myVar = myVar + 5;

to add 5 to myVar. Since this is such a common pattern, 
there are operators which do both a mathematical operation and assignment in one step.

One such operator is the += operator.

myVar += 5; will add 5 to myVar.

Instructions
Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the += operator.


var a = 3;
var b = 17;
var c = 12;

// Only modify code below this line

a = a + 12;
b = 9 + b;
c = c + 7;


 */
a += 12;
b += 9 ;
c += c ;
