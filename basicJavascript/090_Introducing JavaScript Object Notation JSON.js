/**
 * Introducing JavaScript Object Notation JSON
JavaScript Object Notation or JSON uses the format of JavaScript Objects to store data. JSON is flexible because it allows for Data Structures with arbitrary combinations of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects.

Here is an example of a JSON object:

var ourMusic = [
  {
    "artist": "Daft Punk",
    "title": "Homework",
    "release_year": 1997,
    "formats": [ 
      "CD", 
      "Cassette", 
      "LP" ],
    "gold": true
  }
];
This is an array of objects and the object has various pieces of metadata about an album. It also has a nested formats array. Additional album records could be added to the top level array.

Note
You will need a comma in between objects in JSON objects with more than one object in the array.

Instructions
Add a new album to the myMusic JSON object. Add artist and title strings, release_year number, and a formats array of strings.
