Since we're building a CatPhotoApp, let's use something called kitty ipsum text.  --><h2 style="color:blue">CatPhotoApp</h2>  <!-- 设置颜色When you entered <h2 style="color: red">CatPhotoApp</h2>, you were giving that individual h2 element an inline style.

That's one way to add style to an element, but a better way is by using CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets.Remember that you can attach classes to HTML elements by using class="your-class-here" within the relevant element's opening tag.css class<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
