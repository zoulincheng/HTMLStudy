<!--Add Images to your Website
You can add images to your website by using the img element, and point to a specific image's URL using the src attribute.

An example of this would be:

<img src="https://www.your-image-source.com/your-image.jpg">

Note that in most cases, img elements are self-closing.

Try it with this image:

<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }

  h2 {
    font-family: Lobster, Monospace;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: Monospace;
  }
</style>


<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
