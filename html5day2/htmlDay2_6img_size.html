<!--Size your Images
CSS has a property called width that controls an element's width. Just like with fonts, we'll use px (pixels) to specify the image's width.

For example, if we wanted to create a CSS class called larger-image that gave HTML elements a width of 500 pixels, we'd use:

<style>
  .larger-image {
    width: 500px;
  }
</style>
Create a class called smaller-image and use it to resize the image so that it's only 100 pixels wide.

Note
Due to browser implementation differences, you may need to be at 100% zoom to pass the tests on this challenge.
