<!--Turn an Image into a Link
You can make elements into links by nesting them within an a element.

Nest your image within an a element. Here's an example:

<a href="#"><img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-running-cats"></a>

Remember to use # as your a element's href property in order to turn it into a dead link.

Once you've done this, hover over your image with your cursor. Your cursor's normal pointer should become the link clicking pointer. The photo is now a link.
